- **Quantum Scrambling**: How information spreads across quantum sites
- **PT Symmetry**: Parity-time symmetric systems with balanced gain/loss
- **Exceptional Points**: Critical transitions in parameter space
- **Entanglement Dynamics**: Evolution of quantum correlations

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The visual design draws inspiration from:
- Neural network connectivity patterns
- Cymatic mandala structures
- Biofeedback loop visualizations
- Minimal, ambient sci-fi aesthetics
